# non-AI-vs-AI-ML-models
An investigation that aims to assess and compare the performance of machine learning models created by humans and artificial intelligence tools. Three distinct models were constructed and evaluated: a human-made model with no artificial intelligence involvement, a model generated using ChatGPT, and a model generated using a fine-tuned version of ChatGPT. These models predict house prices using a scikit-learn dataset and are evaluated based on the mean squared error, coefficient of determination, and ease of use.
